access: Public; no authentication required; no user-specific state retained.
behaviour: Immediate feedback for all actions, step-by-step animation for traversals,
  undo/redo for editing actions, responsive layout for desktop/tablet.
name: Binary Tree Visualizer
pages:
- behaviour: All controls update the canvas. Traversal actions animate node highlights.
    Undo/redo stack maintained. Validation prevents duplicate/non-integer entries.
  id: main_visualizer
  purpose: Allows users to interactively build or modify a binary tree and visualize
    structural and traversal changes.
  queries:
  - clearTree
  - getTree
  sections:
  - behaviour: Button triggers action. Values validated. Disabled buttons for unavailable
      actions.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Resets tree to empty; disables if already empty.
      id: clear_button
    id: controls_section
    title: Controls
    visual: Vertical stack of input and buttons. Clear spacing, visible grouping.
  - behaviour: Updates with each tree change. Traversal highlights current node. Node
      tooltips on hover display value.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Renders current tree structure with animation. Responds to hover
        (show value) and traversal (highlight).
      id: tree_canvas
    id: canvas_section
    title: Tree Canvas
    visual: White canvas with node circles and connecting edges. Nodes spaced for
      readability. Animated transitions for changes.
  title: Binary Tree Visualizer
  visual: 'Two-column layout: left controls (inputs, buttons), right main canvas (tree).
    Traversal steps appear below the canvas. Clear, readable labels and buttons.'
queries:
- id: clearTree
  responsibility: Empties the tree, resetting to initial state.
- id: getTree
  responsibility: Returns the current tree as a structured object for rendering.
summary: Interactive tool for creating, editing, and visualizing binary trees. Users
  can add or remove nodes, see animated tree rendering, and perform and step through
  traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder).
visual: Modern UI with light backgrounds, accent colors for actions, and a central
  canvas for tree visualization. Nodes and edges are clearly visible, with smooth
  animation for changes.
