access: No authentication required; accessible for all users. Proper use of roles/labels
  for accessibility.
behaviour: Static HTML only; no JavaScript functionality yet. Elements must be accessible
  with semantic HTML and ARIA labels where appropriate. Structure should be responsive
  for desktop and mobile.
name: Create HTML structure for color picker
page:
  behaviour: No dynamic behaviour at this stage. HTML structure is ready for future
    scripting. All containers must have unique IDs for easy selection.
  id: color_picker_html_structure
  purpose: Provides the foundation for the color picker by establishing main containers
    for the UI.
  sections:
  - behaviour: Purely structural. Must have unique ID (e.g., 'color-picker-container').
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Displays a div or canvas serving as the area for color picking (static
        for now).
      id: color_picker_block
    id: color_picker_area
    title: Color Picker Container
    visual: A square div or canvas (e.g. 300x300px max, responsive down on mobile),
      with a border and slight shadow. Centered horizontally.
  - behaviour: Has unique ID (e.g., 'color-swatch'). Only displays a placeholder color
      at this stage.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Displays a div representing the color swatch (non-interactive, static
        color).
      id: color_swatch_block
    id: swatch_area
    title: Color Swatch Display
    visual: A small, bordered square or circle (e.g., 40x40px), centered under the
      color picker container. Visualizes the currently selected color (static placeholder
      color for now).
  title: Color Picker HTML Structure
  visual: Central column layout with generous spacing. The color picker area is prominent,
    with a smaller swatch below. Use subtle shadows and border to separate sections.
summary: Set up the basic HTML file with containers for the color picker and color
  swatch display.
visual: Clean, minimal layout. Center the color picker and swatch on the page. Use
  clear borders and simple backgrounds to distinguish interactive areas.
