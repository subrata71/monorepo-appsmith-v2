access: Accessible to all users of the application. Add ARIA roles and keyboard navigation
  to the color picker for screen readers and improved accessibility.
behaviour: Real-time updates of the color swatch as the user interacts. Immediate
  feedback to user inputs via mouse or touch, and graceful handling of edge cases
  (e.g., clicking/draging outside the picker does not update the color). Smooth transition
  effects for swatch updates. Keyboard accessibility for changing color (using arrow
  keys or tab navigation).
name: Implement color picker interaction logic
page:
  behaviour: On pointer down/touch start in the picker area, begin tracking input.
    On pointer move/touch move, update the selected color and swatch in real time.
    On pointer up/touch end, stop tracking. Prevent interaction outside picker area.
    Arrow keys or tab can move focus and adjust color selection.
  id: color_picker_page
  purpose: Allows users to interactively select a color. Immediate visual feedback
    is provided as the user makes their selection.
  sections:
  - behaviour: Handles pointer and touch events for color selection. Shows a marker
      or handle at the current pick location. Ignores out-of-bounds events.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Add event listeners for mouse/touch start, move, and end. Initiate
        tracking when clicked/touched, update position on move, and stop tracking
        on release.

    id: picker_area
    title: Color Picker Area
    visual: Square or circular interactive area for selecting a color (can be a grid
      or a radial design). Distinct border and hover/focus highlights.
  - behaviour: Translates the position within the picker area (e.g., angle for radial,
      x/y for grid) to a color value (RGB/HEX/HSV as needed).
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Given the pointer position or angle, compute the corresponding color
        value. Update this value in real time as input changes.
      id: calculate_color
    id: color_calculation
    title: Color Calculation
    visual: Not visibleâ€”logic only.
  - behaviour: Updates instantly as the selected color changes. Animates color transition
      for smoother visual feedback.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Change the swatch background color immediately to the newly calculated
        color as user interacts.
      id: swatch_update
    id: swatch_display
    title: Color Swatch
    visual: Large colored rectangle or circle below the picker, showing the current
      selection. Clear border for visibility.
  title: Color Picker
  visual: Single-column layout, with the color picker at the center, instructions
    above, and the color swatch displayed below. Responsive design for both desktop
    and mobile.
summary: Write JavaScript to handle user interaction with the color picker and update
  the swatch in real time.
visual: Adopt a clean, modern UI. Color picker area should be visually distinct, with
  a clear border and perhaps a subtle gradient or checkerboard background. The current
  color swatch is displayed prominently below the picker. Responsive and touch-friendly,
  with accessible contrast and focus styles.
