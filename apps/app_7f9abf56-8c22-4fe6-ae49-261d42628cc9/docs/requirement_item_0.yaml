      2'. Adequate vertical spacing. Input boxes have placeholder text (e.g., 'Enter
      a number').

      and disables while calculating.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: When clicked, reads both inputs, triggers calculateSum query, and
        displays result. Disabled if inputs are invalid.
      id: addButton
    id: add-button-section
    title: Add Button
    visual: A full-width button labeled 'Add' placed below the input fields. Uses
      primary accent color (blue).
  - behaviour: Displays the sum after calculation. Updates when a new calculation
      is performed or inputs are changed. Shows error message if calculation fails.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Displays the calculated sum or an error message.
      id: sumResult
    id: result-display
    title: Result Display

      like 'Result will appear here' if no calculation yet.
  title: Simple Calculator
  visual: 'A single card or panel centered on the page with vertical stacking: two
    number inputs, an Add button, and a result display area below.'
queries:
- id: calculateSum
  responsibility: Accepts two numbers as input and returns their sum. This is required
    to perform the addition and display the result.
summary: A single-page UI that allows users to input two numbers, click an 'Add' button,
  and see the sum displayed. This provides a fast and accessible way to perform basic
  addition without any distractions.
visual: Use a clean, minimal design with a white background. Center all content within
  a card or panel in the middle of the page. Inputs and button should be evenly spaced
  with clear, readable labels and a simple color palette (e.g., blue for primary action,
  gray for secondary).
