# Application Template Overview

This is a full-stack application template designed for rapid development with modern best practices.

## Component-Specific Guidelines

This template consists of two main components, each with their own detailed documentation:

### Frontend
**Location**: `frontend/` directory  
**Documentation**: `@frontend/CLAUDE.md`  
**Focus**: Client-side coding guidelines, component architecture, UI patterns, and development workflow

### Backend  
**Location**: `backend/` directory  
**Documentation**: `@backend/CLAUDE.md`  
**Focus**: Server-side patterns, API development, database operations, and testing strategies

## Development Approach

1. **Frontend Development**: Reference `@frontend/CLAUDE.md` for complete React + TypeScript development guidelines
2. **Backend Development**: Reference `@backend/CLAUDE.md` for complete Fastify + TypeScript backend patterns  
3. **Full-Stack Features**: Coordinate between components following the established patterns in each respective documentation
