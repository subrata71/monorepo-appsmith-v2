    name: Number input fields with validation
    page:
      behaviour: Inputs are validated in real-time. Clicking an operation button calculates
        and displays the result. Keyboard input and tab navigation are supported.
        Error messages show unobtrusively when needed.
      id: main_page
      purpose: Enables users to input two numbers, select an arithmetic operation,
        and immediately see the result. Designed for speed and simplicity.
      queries:
      - calculate
      sections:
      - behaviour: Accepts numeric input only. If input is invalid or missing, disables
          the operation buttons and displays an inline warning.
        blocks:
        - behaviour: Allows user to input the first operand. Accepts numbers only.
          id: first_number_input
        - behaviour: Allows user to input the second operand. Accepts numbers only.

        visual: 'Two horizontally-aligned input fields with labels: ''First Number''
          and ''Second Number''. Inputs are large and easy to select.'
      title: Simple Calculator
      visual: Single card layout, centered on the screen, containing input fields,
        operation buttons, and result area. All elements are vertically stacked with
        ample spacing.
    summary: Create two large, labeled input fields for numeric entry with real-time
      validation. Disable operation buttons and show inline warnings if inputs are
      invalid or missing.
  summary: Implements the main calculator page allowing users to input two numbers,
    select an arithmetic operation, and instantly view the result or error message.
    Includes input validation, operation buttons, and result display with error handling.

      queries:
      - calculate
      sections:
      - behaviour: Clicking a button triggers calculation using both input values
          and the selected operation. If division is selected and the second number
          is zero, an error is shown instead of a result.
        blocks:
        - behaviour: Performs addition of the two numbers.
          id: add_button
        - behaviour: Performs subtraction (first minus second).
          id: subtract_button
        - behaviour: Performs multiplication of the two numbers.
          id: multiply_button
        - behaviour: Performs division (first divided by second), unless second number
            is zero.

      visual: Single card layout, centered on the screen, containing input fields,
        operation buttons, and result area. All elements are vertically stacked with
        ample spacing.
    summary: Create four large, horizontally arranged operation buttons. Ensure they
      are accessible, highlight the selected operation, and trigger calculation on
      click.
  summary: Implement four large, accessible operation buttons (+, -, ×, ÷) that trigger
    calculation when clicked. Visually highlight the selected operation.
