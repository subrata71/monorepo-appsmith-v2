  obstacles, using keyboard controls. The player's score increases over time or distance
  survived. The game ends when the runner collides with an obstacle.

  is clearly visible against the ground. Obstacles are distinct and easily visible.
  The score is displayed in a prominent font in the top right. Game over is shown
  with a semi-transparent overlay and a large, bold font.
