access: Authenticated users can view and manipulate the board. All users with access
  can move tasks, but advanced task editing or board configuration is restricted to
  users with edit rights (not covered in this requirement).
behaviour: Supports drag-and-drop of task cards between columns using a standard library.
  Columns and tasks update in real-time upon interaction. Animated transitions when
  dragging/dropping. Tasks update status immediately and visually reflect their new
  state. Board layout and state persist on refresh. Accessible keyboard navigation
  for drag-and-drop wherever possible.
name: Task Board UI
page:
  behaviour: Page loads all columns and tasks on entry. Users drag tasks between columns
    to update status. Changes are saved immediately. Provides responsive feedback
    and accessibility support.
  id: task-board
  purpose: Allows users to visualize and manage tasks by status, quickly update status
    using drag-and-drop, and track progress across the workflow.
  sections:
  - behaviour: Columns render dynamically for each task status. Supports drag-and-drop
      operations between columns. Columns update their content as tasks move.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Displays tasks in the given status. Accepts dropped task cards and
        updates their status.
      id: status-column
    id: board-layout
    title: Board Layout
    visual: Columns are arranged side by side, visually separated with card styling.
      Each has a header with status name. Columns are horizontally scrollable if overflowing.
  - behaviour: Cards are draggable within and between columns. Visual feedback (shadow,
      ghost card) during drag. Cards reorder on drop.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Draggable task element. On drop in new column, triggers status update
        in data model.
      id: task-card
    id: task-cards
    title: Task Cards
    visual: Each task is a card with a light background, shadow, and rounded corners.
      Task title is prominent, and optionally displays metadata. Drag handle appears
      on hover or always on touch devices.
  - behaviour: Implements drag-and-drop with a library (e.g., react-beautiful-dnd).
      On drop, updates task position and column. Reorders within columns. Accessible
      via mouse and (if possible) keyboard.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Handles drag events, updates state, triggers animations and data
        model updates.
      id: drag-drop-handler
    id: drag-and-drop
    title: Drag-and-Drop
    visual: Dragging shows a semi-transparent ghost card. Drop zones highlighted in
      columns. Animations on card movement.
  - behaviour: On card drop, updates the task's status in the backend or data model
      and re-renders the UI to reflect the change. Handles errors gracefully.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Updates the persistent data model for the task's new status after
        drag-and-drop.
      id: status-update
    id: data-update
    title: Task Status Update
    visual: On successful drop, the task animates into place in the new column. Optional
      checkmark or toast notification for confirmation.
  title: Task Board
  visual: Layout is a horizontally scrollable kanban board. Each status is a column
    with a header. Tasks are cards in columns. Clean, minimal, with soft color indicators
    for status.
summary: Create the main task board interface with columns representing different
  task statuses. Users can view tasks as cards in columns and move them between statuses
  using drag-and-drop, with real-time status updates.
visual: Modern, clean UI with a light or neutral background. Each status column has
  a distinct card with soft shadow and rounded corners. Tasks are displayed as elevated
  cards. Accent color for selected/dragged items. Responsive layout supporting both
  desktop and mobile. Clear, high-contrast labels and readable fonts.
