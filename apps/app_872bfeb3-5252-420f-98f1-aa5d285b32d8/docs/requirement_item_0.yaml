access: Public access; no restrictions. All users can view and interact with calendar
  features.
behaviour: 'Responsive design for mobile and desktop. Smooth month transitions with
  animation. Keyboard accessible: arrow keys allow navigation between days and months.
  All grid days are focusable; clicking does nothing yet. All controls are labeled
  for screen readers.'
name: Calendar UI
page:
  behaviour: On page load, shows the current month. Navigation controls switch month,
    animating the grid. Days in the grid update accordingly. All days are accessible
    by keyboard. The structure is ready for future extensibility (e.g., day selection).
  id: calendar_main
  purpose: Allow users to view the days of any month and navigate between months for
    scheduling or information purposes.
  sections:
  - behaviour: Left/right arrows move to previous/next month, updating the grid and
      label. Month/year label updates in sync with grid.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: On click, decrements month and updates grid. Disabled if minimum
        date reached (future extension).
      id: prev_month_button
    - behaviour: Displays current month and year; updates when navigation occurs.
      id: month_year_label
    - behaviour: On click, increments month and updates grid. Disabled if maximum
        date reached (future extension).
      id: next_month_button
    id: calendar_header
    title: Header
    visual: 'Horizontal alignment: left arrow, centered month/year, right arrow. Arrows
      are buttons with subtle hover/focus effect. Month/year in bold.'
  - behaviour: Shows all days of the current month in order. Cells for days are focusable
      and highlight on hover or focus. No click actions for now. Grid updates when
      month changes.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Displays static weekday abbreviations (e.g., Sun, Mon, etc.) at grid
        top.
      id: weekday_headers
    - behaviour: Renders date numbers for each day cell in the current month. Each
        cell is focusable. No action on click.
      id: calendar_days
    id: calendar_grid
    title: Month Grid
    visual: 7-column grid with weekday headers on top. Day cells are square with slight
      hover effect. Empty cells fill leading/trailing spaces as needed.
  title: Calendar
  visual: Calendar page is centered with header (month/year and navigation) above
    the month grid. Grid fills available width on mobile, with max width on desktop.
    Consistent spacing and padding. Navigation and focus highlights in primary brand
    color.
summary: Create a basic calendar interface with a grid view of days for the current
  month and controls to navigate to previous and next months.
visual: Minimal, modern, and clean interface. White background, subtle grey borders,
  rounded corners. Sans-serif font for clarity. Month/year title is bold and centered.
  Navigation controls use simple left/right arrows. Calendar grid is 7 columns (Sun-Sat),
  with light hover effect on days.
