access: No login is required. All data is stored locally for the current browser profile
  only. Anyone with access to the browser can see the mood history.
behaviour: On page load, the app retrieves existing mood entries from localStorage
  and displays them with the most recent first. When a new mood is logged, it's added
  to the top of the list and saved to localStorage. All changes are reflected immediately
  in the UI. Scrolling is enabled for long lists. No server communication is required.
