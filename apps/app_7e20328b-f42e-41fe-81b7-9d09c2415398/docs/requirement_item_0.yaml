    a reasonable character limit (e.g., 200 chars). Submit button is only enabled
    after a mood is selected. On submit, entry is saved and the form resets with a
    confirmation message.
  id: mood-entry-ui
  purpose: Allow users to quickly and easily log their current mood and an optional
    note, with data privacy ensured through local storage.
  sections:
  - behaviour: One mood may be selected at a time. Clicking an icon updates the selected
      mood and highlights the chosen option.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Renders the predefined mood options as icons/buttons. Updates internal
        state on click to reflect the selected mood.

    visual: Horizontal row (or grid on small screens) of large, easily-tappable mood
      icon buttons (smiley, neutral, sad, etc).
  - behaviour: Optional input. Input is trimmed. Enforces character limit. Updates
      internal state on input.

      Placeholder guides user. Character counter if limit enforced.
  - behaviour: On click, validates selection and note, saves to localStorage or in-memory,
      resets form, and shows a non-intrusive confirmation (e.g. snackbar).
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Validates and saves the entry (mood + note) locally. Triggers UI
        reset and feedback on success.
      id: submit-mood

  input fields. Primary color accents to indicate selection. Adequate spacing between
