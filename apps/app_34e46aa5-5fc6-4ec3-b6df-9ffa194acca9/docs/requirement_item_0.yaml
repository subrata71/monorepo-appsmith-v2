        faded/struck-through if done.

    title: Reminders
    visual: Vertical list of cards or items. Each item displays reminder text, completion
      status, and action buttons. Completed items are visually faded and/or struck-through.
      Buttons for actions are icon-based with tooltips.
  title: Reminder List
  visual: Centered, scrollable list. Each reminder is a card or list item with actions
    to the right. Consistent padding, rounded borders, and subtle shadows. Easy to
    distinguish between active and completed reminders.
summary: Create a user interface to display, mark as completed, and delete reminders
  from a local list.
visual: Clean, minimalistic layout with clear separation between reminder items. Use
  a modern sans-serif font, light background, and accent colors for key actions (e.g.,
  mark as done - green, delete - red). Completed reminders are visually distinct (e.g.,
  faded text, strikethrough).
