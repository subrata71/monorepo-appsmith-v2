access: No authentication required. All users can access the stopwatch functionality
  from the browser.

  Keyboard navigation is supported.
name: Stopwatch Prototype Logic
page:
  behaviour: Page initializes with timer at 00:00:00, Start/Stop button enabled, Reset
    disabled. Pressing Start begins the timer (button changes to Stop), which updates
    every second. Pressing Stop halts the time (button changes to Start). Reset sets
    the time to 00:00:00 and disables Reset if timer is already zero or running.
  id: stopwatch
  purpose: Provide users with an interactive stopwatch interface that can be started,
    stopped, and reset easily for timing activities.
  sections:
  - behaviour: Displays current elapsed time, updates every second when running, resets
      to 00:00:00 when Reset is pressed.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Renders and updates the elapsed time in real-time. Always shows the
        actual timer value (HH:MM:SS).
      id: timer_display_block
    id: timer_display_section
    title: Time Display
    visual: Large, bold, centered time in HH:MM:SS format using a monospace font.
  - behaviour: Start/Stop button toggles the timer; label changes based on state.
      Reset resets timer to zero and disables when timer is zero or running. Both
      buttons are keyboard accessible and visually indicate active/disabled states.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: On press, starts or stops the timer depending on current state. Button
        label dynamically changes between Start and Stop.
      id: start_stop_button_block
    - behaviour: On press, resets the timer to 00:00:00. Button disabled if timer
        is running or at 00:00:00.
      id: reset_button_block
    id: controls_section
    title: Controls
    visual: Two large horizontally aligned buttons labeled Start/Stop and Reset, spaced
      evenly below the display.
  title: Stopwatch
  visual: 'Centered column layout: Large digital time display at the top, followed
    by horizontally aligned Start/Stop and Reset buttons below. Clear visual feedback
    on button states. Uses monospace font for the time display.'
summary: Implement simple front-end logic to make the stopwatch UI interactive, allowing
  users to start, stop, and reset the timer.
visual: Minimal, clean interface with a large digital time display and two prominent
  buttons (Start/Stop, Reset). Use of high-contrast colors for accessibility. Layout
  is centered with clear spacing around elements.
