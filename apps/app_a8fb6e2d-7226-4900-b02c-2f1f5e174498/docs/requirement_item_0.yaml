access: No special access restrictions. All users can view and operate the stopwatch.
behaviour: All interactions are immediately reflected in the UI (e.g., pressing Start
  begins timer, pressing Stop pauses, pressing Reset returns to 00:00:00). Button
  states (enabled/disabled) adapt to the stopwatch state. Layout is responsive and
  supports keyboard navigation.
name: Stopwatch UI Layout
page:
  behaviour: Page auto-centers content and adapts to screen size. Controls are accessible
    via keyboard and provide focus indication. Button states update dynamically.
  id: stopwatch_ui
  purpose: 'Allows users to operate a stopwatch: displaying elapsed time, starting,
    stopping, and resetting the timer.'
  sections:
  - behaviour: Displays elapsed time, updates in real time when running. Resets to
      00:00:00 on reset.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Shows the current elapsed time in HH:MM:SS; updates every second
        when running; resets to zero on reset.
      id: elapsed_time_display
    id: display_section
    title: Time Display
    visual: Large, centered, bold monospace font for displaying time (e.g., 00:00:00).
      Clearly separated from controls below.
  - behaviour: '''Start/Stop'' button toggles the running state of the stopwatch and
      updates its label; ''Reset'' button sets time to zero and disables itself when
      already at zero.'
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Toggles between running and stopped states. Label updates to 'Start'
        or 'Stop' accordingly. Keyboard accessible.
      id: start_stop_button
    - behaviour: Resets stopwatch to zero and stops it. Disabled if time is already
        at zero. Keyboard accessible.
      id: reset_button
    id: controls_section
    title: Stopwatch Controls
    visual: Row of two large, rounded buttons ('Start/Stop' and 'Reset'), spaced apart,
      below the time display. Buttons change color or style when pressed/active.
  title: Stopwatch
  visual: Vertically and horizontally centered content. Time display at the top, followed
    by control buttons laid out horizontally below. Clear separation and spacing between
    display and controls.
summary: Design the basic UI for the stopwatch, including time display and control
  buttons (Start/Stop, Reset).
visual: Simple, modern layout with a dark or neutral background, large, centered time
  display in a monospace font, and prominent control buttons with clear labels. Use
  high contrast for readability. Buttons have rounded corners and visual feedback
  on interaction.
