  validation, delivers instant submission feedback, and features a modern UI. No backend

visual: 'Modern, clean, and inviting layout. Use white or light backgrounds, rounded
  corners, generous padding, and a primary accent color (e.g., blue #2563EB for buttons/highlights).
  Use a sans-serif font. Form is centered on the page, responsive for mobile and desktop.
  Success messages use a green alert style. Optionally use a framework like Tailwind
  or Bootstrap.'
