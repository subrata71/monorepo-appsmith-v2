access: All signed-in users can remove habits from their list. No special permissions
  or confirmation dialogs are required.
behaviour: Removing a habit only updates the UI (in-memory list), no backend/API calls.
  The removal is immediate and visually animated. Users cannot undo removals, and
  they can remove as many habits as they wish. The UI updates automatically to reflect
  the in-memory state.
name: Remove Habit UI
page:
  behaviour: Habits can be removed from the UI immediately; the change is not persisted.
    The habit disappears with a fade-out animation. If no habits remain, display the
    empty state.
  id: habit-list
  purpose: Show all habits and allow users to remove them from their UI list.
  sections:
  - behaviour: Each card displays the habit name and remove button. Clicking the remove
      button deletes the habit from the in-memory array and triggers a fade-out before
      removing from the DOM.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Represents a habit. Shows name and remove button. Reacts to remove
        by visually fading out and then being removed from the displayed list.
      id: habit-card
    - behaviour: On click, removes only this habit from the in-memory list. Card uses
        fade-out transition before disappearing.
      id: remove-habit-button
    id: habit-cards
    title: Habits
    visual: Each habit is a rounded card with a soft shadow and spacing. Remove button
      is a red-outlined circle with an 'X', always visible on hover or focus.
  - behaviour: Appears only if all habits have been removed. Hides automatically if
      a habit is added back.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Appears only when no habits remain in the in-memory list.
      id: empty-state-message
    id: empty-state
    title: Empty State
    visual: Centered text and optional icon in muted tone, friendly message like 'No
      habits to display. Add a new habit to get started!'
  title: My Habits
  visual: Single column, habits displayed in stacked cards. Each card contains the
    habit name and a remove button on the right. Empty state message in center if
    list is empty.
summary: Allow users to remove a habit from the list (UI only, no persistence).
visual: Minimalist, card-like layout for each habit with a visible remove button (red
  outlined 'X') on the right side of each card. Use a light color palette. When a
  habit is removed, the card disappears with a smooth transition. If no habits remain,
  show a friendly empty state message centered on the page.
