access: Public component; no authentication or role-specific restrictions.
behaviour: UI-only. Checking/unchecking is immediate and local (no persistence). All
  controls are keyboard accessible. No side effects beyond visual state change.
name: Habit List UI
page:
  behaviour: User checks/unchecks boxes to mark completion. All state is local to
    the UI and resets on reload. Supports mouse, touch, and keyboard navigation.
  id: habit-list-ui-page
  purpose: Allow users to view a list of habits and mark daily completion via an interactive
    interface.
  sections:
  - behaviour: Holds the header and habit list blocks. Focuses user attention visually.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Displays the static heading 'Your Habits' in bold, larger text at
        the top of the card.
      id: card-header
    - behaviour: Shows at least 3 example habits (e.g. 'Drink Water', 'Exercise',
        'Read a Book') in a fixed order with no edit controls.

    title: Habit List Card
    visual: Card container with inner padding and vertical spacing between header
      and list items.
  - behaviour: Each row's control can be toggled on/off. Checked state changes visual
      style (e.g. checkmark, color fill). No persistence; resets on reload. Fully
      accessible.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Checkbox/toggle for each habit. Immediate local state change; supports
        mouse click and keyboard (space/enter). Visual state reflects checked/unchecked.
      id: completion-checkbox
    id: habit-list-controls
    title: Habit Completion Controls
    visual: 'Each habit row is split: habit name left, checkbox/toggle right. Checkbox
      is standard Material or system component.'
  title: Your Habits
  visual: Centered card with subtle shadow, white background, rounded corners, and
    vertical stacking. Habits listed with checkboxes/toggles aligned right. Title/header
    above the list.
summary: Create a user interface to display a list of habits and their daily completion
  status. Users can visually mark each habit as complete for the day. No data storage
  or backend required.
visual: Minimal, clean layout with a card containing a vertically stacked list. Each
  habit is a row with its name and a checkbox/toggle. Responsive and accessible (high
  contrast, visible focus indicators).
