access: No authentication or roles—all users have full use. No restrictions or personalized
  data; purely client-side and session-based.
behaviour: All streaks are tracked in browser memory—no persistence. When a user marks
  a habit as done for the day, the streak increases and is displayed immediately.
  If the user refreshes or closes the page, all streak data is lost. UI disables 'mark
  as done' action if already completed for the current day. No login or user management.
name: Basic Habit Streak Display
page:
  behaviour: All streak increments are in memory. Clicking 'Mark as Done' increases
    the streak if not already done for today, disables the button, and gives a short
    visual animation (e.g., streak badge pulses or turns green). On reload, all counts
    reset. No backend calls or storage.
  id: habit_home
  purpose: Let users view their list of habits and see the current (session-based)
    streak for each. Provide an intuitive way to increment the streak for today's
    completion, visually reinforcing progress.
  sections:
  - behaviour: Dynamically renders all habits. Each card manages its own streak state.
      When user clicks 'Mark as Done', streak number increments, button disables,
      and badge animates with a brief highlight. All UI state is reset on reload.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Shows the habit name, left-aligned, bold.
      id: habit_name
    - behaviour: Displays current streak count with icon. Animates on increment. Resets
        to zero on reload.
      id: streak_badge
    - behaviour: Lets user increment today's streak if not done. Disables after click
        until next day or reload. Gives quick feedback animation on activation.
      id: mark_done_button
    id: habit_list_section
    title: Habits and Streaks
    visual: Each habit in a card or row with a subtle shadow and light background.
      Habit name large and left-aligned. Streak badge (bold number and small flame
      or lightning icon) on the right. 'Mark as Done' button placed near streak badge,
      turning gray or disabled after use each day.
  title: Habit List & Streaks
  visual: 'Card list or vertical stack. Each habit card/row: habit name on left, streak
    count badge on right with a highlight or icon. Green accent for active/incremented
    streak. Minimalist, with spacing and hover effects for interactivity.'
summary: Show a simple streak count for each habit in the UI, with all data stored
  in memory and lost on refresh. Users can see and increment their current streak
  for each habit, but no persistence is involved.
visual: 'Simple, modern interface. Each habit appears as a card or row with the habit
  name on the left and the streak count (with a small flame or badge) on the right.
  Light backgrounds (#FFF, #F7FAFC), accent color (e.g., #22C55E), clear readable
  fonts (Inter, sans-serif). Responsive for mobile and desktop. Streak number uses
  a larger, bold font next to a streak icon.'
