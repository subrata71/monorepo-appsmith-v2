access: No authentication required. Open to any visitor. All controls should be accessible
  via keyboard and have aria-labels as appropriate for screen readers.
behaviour: All interactions are client-side. The wheel animates smoothly when spun,
  randomly lands on a slot, and visually highlights the result. The 'Spin' button
  is disabled during spinning. Results are shown immediately after the spin completes.
  Accessible via keyboard and screen reader.
name: Roulette Wheel UI Prototype
page:
  behaviour: User clicks 'Spin'; wheel animates for a few seconds and randomly selects
    a slot. The UI makes it clear which slot won and disables the spin button until
    the animation ends. Everything runs in the browser, with no persistence.
  id: roulette_ui
  purpose: Allow users to interactively spin a roulette wheel and see the randomly
    chosen result for UI/UX prototyping purposes.
  sections:
  - behaviour: Renders the wheel and animates the spin. Once the animation ends, highlights
      the slot that was selected.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Draws and animates the roulette wheel. Controls highlighting and
        selection states for slots.

      highlighted after a spin.

      wheel animation. Re-enables when the animation completes.

    id: spin_action
    title: Spin Control

      when a new spin starts.

        spin.
      id: result_text

    title: Result Display
    visual: Winning number shown in large, bold type. May use color or animation to
      draw attention.
  title: Roulette Wheel
  visual: A single centered roulette wheel, with the 'Spin' button below. Winning
    result is shown below or beside the wheel. Ample white space and a clear, uncluttered
    layout.
summary: An interactive front-end prototype of a roulette wheel that can be spun by
  the user, visually highlights the winning number, and does not require any backend
  or data persistence.
visual: Focus on a central, visually appealing roulette wheel rendered in canvas or
  SVG, with vibrant alternating colors for slots. UI is modern, clean, minimal, and
  mobile responsive. The spin button is prominent and matches the theme of the wheel.
