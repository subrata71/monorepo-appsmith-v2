access: Anyone can play the game in their browser. No login or registration. No admin
  features. No persistent data beyond current session.
behaviour: Game renders in real-time (ideally 60fps) in a canvas. Paddle responds
  immediately to keyboard and mouse. Collision logic is immediate and accurate. Game
  state (score, bricks remaining, ball/paddle position) updates live. Game resets
  on page reload. No authentication or persistent storage needed.
name: DX Ball Web App Prototype
page:
  behaviour: Game starts automatically on page load. Paddle is controlled by arrow
    keys or A/D, and optionally by mouse movement. Game loop continuously renders
    game state and processes input. Ball bounces off paddle, walls, and destroys bricks
    on contact. Score updates live. When all bricks are gone or player loses the ball,
    game shows a simple 'Game Over' or 'You Win' message and final score.
  id: dxball_main_page
  purpose: Allow the user to play a full game of DX Ball, see their score, and interact
    with the game controls within a single page.
  sections:
  - behaviour: Updates live as bricks are destroyed. Shows final score at game end.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Displays current and final score as text. Updates in real-time.
      id: score_block
    id: score_section
    title: Score Display
    visual: Full-width, single-row panel above the canvas with bold neon score text.
      No buttons or controls here.
  - behaviour: All game rendering, input, and logic occurs here. Mouse/keyboard events
      tied to paddle movement. Ball and bricks managed by game loop.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: HTML5 canvas. Draws paddle, ball, bricks, and background every frame.
        Processes game state and collision logic.
      id: game_canvas_block
    id: canvas_section
    title: Game Area
    visual: Main, centered canvas element (at least 640x480), with black or dark blue
      background, neon bricks, paddle, and ball. Visually separated from the rest
      of the page with padding or a subtle border.
  - behaviour: 'Static content. Explains: ''Move paddle: Arrow keys, A/D, or Mouse''.'
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Displays static instructions for controlling the paddle.
      id: controls_hint_block
    id: controls_section
    title: Controls Hint
    visual: Small, unobtrusive panel below the canvas. Slightly faded text for instructions.
  title: DX Ball Game
  visual: Central canvas (minimum 640x480), surrounded by dark background, neon-themed
    elements. Score shown above the game area. Simple instruction/hint panel below.
    Everything is visually uncluttered, with clear, vibrant colors for interactive
    elements.
summary: Create a single-page web app that allows a user to play a basic version of
  DX Ball, with a paddle, ball, bricks, and scoring system. The game should be simple,
  visually retro, and playable in modern browsers, using keyboard/mouse controls for
  the paddle.
visual: 'Retro arcade look: dark background, neon colors for bricks and paddle, pixel-style
  fonts, with a central canvas. Minimalist layout, with a focus on the game area.
  The score panel is visually distinct above the playfield. Responsive for desktop
  and tablet, with clear margins.'
