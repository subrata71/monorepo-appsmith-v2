access: All authenticated users who can mark items as done will see toast notifications.
  No change in permission model is required.
behaviour: Whenever a user marks an item as done, a toast notification appears with
  a confirmation message (e.g., 'Item marked as done!'). Toast disappears automatically
  after 3 seconds or can be closed manually. If multiple items are marked quickly,
  toasts stack up to 3; older toasts fade out as new ones arrive. Toasts are non-blocking
  and do not interrupt user flow.
name: Add toast message when item is marked as done
page:
  behaviour: When a user marks an item as done, the UI updates the item status visually
    and triggers a toast. Toasts appear for 3 seconds and stack as needed. Page remains
    responsive throughout.
  id: items_page
  purpose: Allows users to view their items and mark them as done with immediate feedback
    via toast notification.
  queries:
  - markItemDone
  - getItems
  sections:
  - behaviour: On clicking a checkbox or 'done' button, triggers the 'markItemDone'
      query and updates local UI immediately. Success triggers a toast.
    blocks:
    - behaviour: Represents an individual item row/card. Contains 'mark as done' control
        (checkbox/button). On click, fires 'markItemDone', updates UI, and requests
        toast component to display success message.
      id: item_row_block
    id: item_list_section
    title: Item List
    visual: Vertically stacked cards or rows, each containing an item with a checkbox
      or 'done' button.
  - behaviour: Toast displays upon successful completion of 'mark as done' action.
      Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds. Supports manual close. Stacks and manages overflow
      as described.
    blocks:

        shows overlay, and dismisses after timeout or on user action.
      id: toast_block
    id: toast_section
    title: Toast Notifications
    visual: Small, rounded, shadowed overlays at the bottom right. Green accent for
      success. Stacks up to 3 messages.
  title: Items List
  visual: Page displays items in a list or card format with a clear 'mark as done'
    action on each. Toast notifications appear as overlays in the bottom right corner,
    styled per visual guidelines.
queries:
- id: markItemDone
  responsibility: Updates the status of an item to 'done' in the backend and returns
    a success response.
- id: getItems
  responsibility: Fetches the list of items and their statuses for display in the
    UI.
summary: Show a toast notification to the user when they mark an item as done in the
  UI, providing immediate feedback and confirmation of the action.
visual: Toast notifications should use the existing design system, with a small popup
  appearing in the lower right (or platform-standard position). Use green coloring
  for success, with a subtle shadow and rounded corners. Font, iconography, and animation
  should be consistent with the application's design language.
